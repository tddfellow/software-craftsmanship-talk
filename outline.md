# Software Craftsmanship

Outline:

- Software Craftsmanship and Agile Software Development are connected:
  - while Agile Software Development is concerned with managing the work
  - Software Craftsmanship is focusing on how you as an Engineer can deliver a good work
- Why do we need to deliver a good work?
  - Quality and Speed are always in tension
  - Software. Software. Everywhere.
  - Compromising quality is harmful:
    - at worst: people die and companies die
    - at best: engineering team slows down over time
- Pillars of Software Craftsmanship:
  - Balancing between Quality & Speed to attain Sustainable Pace
  - Taking public interest into account (not only your employer's/client's interest)
    - Not harming public, employer and client
  - Transparency:
    - Make the impact of quality & speed decisions visible and transparent
  - Sharing:
    - Transfer knowledge to fellow engineers
      - Unfortunately, usually, our discipline is being taught accidentally, not explicitly
  - Learning:
    - Improving and honing one's skills over time
    - Exploring new things to have different angle of view
